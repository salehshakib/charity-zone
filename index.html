        <h1>Let’s Help Those Who Are More In Need</h1>
        <p>
          In the last few weeks, millions of people in the Sylhet and Sunamganj
          districts have experienced heavy rains and flash floods, leaving them
          homeless and without possessions. With homes crushed, objects floating
          away and people missing, the country is at high alert. But you can
          help them.

          <h3>Food for a family</h3>
          <p>
            There are almost 40 million people suffering people in Bangladesh,
            one quarter of the people of this densely populated country, who
            remain food insecure, lacking reliable access to enough food to get
            by, not knowing where their next meal may come from.
          </p>
          <p>
            These starving people suffer each day and night in this food crisis,
            with over 5 million children suffering severe complications such as
            stunted growth and malnutrition induced by this lack of basic
            nourishment.

          <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
          <p>
            Finding shelter is critical in times of disaster. Shelter outside of
            the hazard area could include staying with family or friends,
            seeking a hotel room, or staying in a mass shelter.
          </p>
          <p>
            These homeless people suffer each day and night in this shelter
            crisis.

          <h3>Education for a child</h3>
          <p>
            Education is a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty;
            supporting child survival, growth, development and well-being; and
            closing the gap in social inequality.
          </p>
          <p>
            A child’s right to education entails the right to learn. Yet, for
            too many children across the globe, schooling does not lead to
            learning.

            Volunteering your time, money, or energy to help others doesn’t just
            make the world better—it also makes you better. Studies indicate
            that the very act of giving back to the community boosts your
            happiness, health, and sense of well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            Helping others, especially those who are less fortunate than
            yourself, can help to put things into perspective and make you feel
            more positive about your own circumstances.
